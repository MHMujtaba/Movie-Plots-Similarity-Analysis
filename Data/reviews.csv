19995,Avatar is an overwhelming immersive spectacle. The state-of-the-art 3D technology draws us in but it is the vivid weirdness of Cameron's luridly imagined tropical other world that keeps us fascinated. I like this film and I have written many review for essay writing service. The special effects are so good here that you don't even notice them. It is eerie how Cameron has made it look and feel like he is just pointing a camera at the action.
19995,"It's cinema Jim but not as we know it.
So here it is then what has been in gestation in James Cameron's mind for over 12 years finally hit the silver screen towards the back end of 2009. Made for gazillions amount of cash Avatar went on to make a billion trillion in Worldwide receipts-and this before the rush rush release of DVD/BLU RAY sales are factored into the equation. The film and all its technical wizardry is quite simply a gargantuan piece of cinematic history. Released in 2d and 3d and probably some other format that I'm forgetting every advanced tool of the trade has been u... read the rest."
19995,"Rewatching Avatar confirmed my love for Pandora. Exquisite world-building by James Cameron memorable score by James Horner & jaw-dropping innovative visuals that complement wonderful storytelling.

19995,Technically its a very good film
19995,"This is another of these films for which I didn't get the memo. It undoubtedly has parallels with the ecological ravaging of Earth by mankind but for the most part it is just a fairly standard action romance that owes much of it's significance to it being an outstanding technical production. Sam Worthington is ""Jake"" a paraplegic solider who is tasked with assisting on a mission on a distant planet. By way of a bribe the authorities offer him surgery to restore his mobility if he uses an avatar machine to infiltrate the folks inhabiting the planet ""Pandora"".

285,"Now this is just far far too long. At ten minutes shy of three hours the story just isn't substantial enough to sustain it and I must confess to finding my attention dwindling a bit at various stages of the proceedings. Thankfully Geoffrey Rush has rejoined the cast as the whole ensemble must now risk life and limb - and sail to the very edge of the world - to save ""Jack"" (Johnny Depp) from oblivion and thwart the seemingly unstoppable ""Lord Beckett"" (Tom Hollander). How to do this? Well they must galvanise the entire global pirate community and that means the dreaded ""Sao Feng"" (Chow Yun-Fat... read the rest."
206647,In hindsight my excitement for Spectre seems a bit foolish. After Skyfall director Sam Mendes openly stated that he wouldn’t direct another Bond movie. And even so Skyfall wasn’t the best of the new Bond films by any measure – dragging on for much too long. But somehow I got sucked into the hype of Mendes’ vision for an homage to the classic Bond with that somewhat iconic poster of Craig mimicking Roger Moore and trailers the emphasized a kind of retro re-visitation of some old villains and themes. But Spectre is none of those th... read the rest.

Worldwide Agent 007 fans understandably maintain their embedded expectations and vision as to what calculating and cunning mission their suave and sophisticated gun-toting martini-sipping espionage thrill-seeker will encounter in his latest globe-trotting episode. Whatever Bond enthusiasts have in mind for the future twenty-fifth entry of the “licensed to kill” Lothario they should simply settle for... read the rest.

206647,"Not your usual Bond movie but still a good entertainer.
What I liked from a couple of last Bond movies was they were off the regular 007 style like not overly rely on spy's special gadgets. This change has been since the day one of Daniel Craig as a famous British spy James Bond. Anyway he's the most fittest (muscular) Bond I've ever seen and he's celebrating 10 year anniversary with this film release. But the question is whether he to do another film or done with the franchise. The doubt after the confusing end of this film.

""Spectre fails to reach the tremendous potential of its intriguing narrative and fascinating antagonist but Sam Mendes still pulls off a decent James Bond flick.

By the time Spectre came out I was honestly sick of Daniel Craig's James Bond hates being James Bond depiction. And now I've come to really despise him I mean Moore used to be my least favorite Bond and I like him so much more than Craig.
But... the script was kind of all over the place. I think they were trying to do twists and turns but they were stuck under steering with each turn so all the twists they tried to throw at you never really worked. It ended up feeling like they were trying to be confusing for the sak... read the rest."
206647,"Spectre has plenty of style class action and spectacular moments but the film lacks the passion and zeal of Casino Royale or Skyfall.
After the incredible bombastic success of Skyfall the return of Sam Mendes and the announcement of Christoph Waltz as the villain expectations skyrocketed to ridiculous heights. Unfortunately these expectations climbed too high for Spectre to meet. While the story did a decent job of trying to tie all the Craig Bond films together and introduce a new supreme criminal mastermind it didn't fully satisfy or carry the weight it intended. There were som... read the rest."
206647,Spectre has an introspect into what is wrong with modern Bond movies. Namely that they don't work because 007 is about action exotic sceneries cinematic brilliance beautiful women gadgets that go wrong or right and most of all the wit and charm and atmosphere. I'm not sure when the forma should have changed from exciting to dull probably around 1995 but it changed before that year. And it should have changed in a productive and interesting way. Instead it changed to just total dullness with not one good aspect. The motivation of characters other than 007 is total zero in credibil... read the rest.
49026,"I felt like this was a tremendous end to Nolan's Batman trilogy. The Dark Knight Rises may very well have been the weakest of all 3 films but when you're talking about a scale of this magnitude it still makes this one of the best movies I've seen in the past few years.
I expected a little more Batman than we got (especially with a runtime of 2:45) but while the story around the fall of Bruce Wayne and Gotham City was good I didn't find it amazing. This might be in fact one of my only criticisms—it was a long movie but still maybe too short for the story I felt was really being told. I f... read the rest."
49026,"I personally thought this film is on par if not better than the Dark Knight.
Whilst some think the film is too long for the story I didn't find this. The length of the film is longer than some (but doesn't feel it) I liked that the film took it's time rather than shoving more elements in it - I think this contributed to the dramatic ending (much like a classical piece of music will be relaxed and calm before the final crescendo).
At the end of the day whether you like this film will boil down to if you like films Christopher Nolan has directed and/or you like the Christopher Nolan Batman... read the rest."
49026,The Dark Knight Rises is one of the best movies to come out in 2012. The story compels you to watch it time and time again. It also has I of I my opinion the best bad guys in any movie Bane! Batman was well played as all ways and the cast where well selected. I think this movie is the best batman to see the light of day or the darkest nights (pun intended).
49026,No doubt that the movie is one of the best movies of this era. The film doesn't lack in whatever it try to do.It has Simple narration with extraordinary DirectionActingMusicCinematography and a lot of qualities. Christian Bale is supremely entertaining for sure. The person behind the scenes is actually the real core creater of the film yes! The Director Christopher Nolan ❤ . The film ofcorse completes with philosophical quality loaded with Lots of Sacrifices. This one is the one you surely can't afford to miss. Go watch The Dark Knight.Go now.
49026,While it's clearly not as superlative as its famous predecessor it's simply because of both Heath Ledger's outstanding and Oscar-winning performance and the character of the Joker's etching in our collective unconscious as the greatest comic-book villain ever created (with Lex Luthor a very distant second place). This is still a masterwork and is an excellent coda to the finest filmic trilogy ever made. As great as Christopher Nolan is as a director and as fine a film as 'Interstellar' is I really don't know if he'll ever be able to top his work here on these three films. But I for one... read the rest.

Going into the theatre tonight I actually wasn't sure what I was up for. I loved Batman Begins but I didn't actually care that much for The Dark Knight. So the big question was will TDKR actually be more like the first or the second film? The answer is: neither.
This third instalment of the Nolan-franchise carries its weight all on its own merits. Despite the lack of any kind of intro or opening credits there actually is plent... read the rest."

Thus when Christopher Nolan brought us Batman Begins and steered away from the ridiculous comic shows that the previous batman movies (except the first one) had turned into I was thrilled. Unfortunately I was equally disappointed with this one.
I think the title of the movie is quite misleading since Batman isn’t exactly rising at all but rather sinking. If... read the rest."

I really love this film and consider it one of Nolan's better works and I wish more people on the Internet would start giving it more respect.

49026,"Tom Hardy is superb in this denouement to Christopher Nolan's ""Batman"" trilogy. His depiction of the clever and malevolent ""Bane"" is intricate and terrifying in equal measure. Christian Bale also has the role very much under control now as he joins forces with his old pal ""Gordon"" (Gary Oldman) and jewel thief turned ""Catwoman"" (Anne Hathaway) to rise to his biggest challenge yet...

49529,"Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote his series of John Carter novels before space flight was more than a fancy. This movie is more adventure and romance and very little (if any) actual science.
This movie is the best production of A Princess of Mars the first story in the series that I've seen.
If you're a fan of the John Carter novels then you will probably get some enjoyment from John Carter. While there are some differences you'll meet some familiar characters and recognize quite a few relevant plot points.
Not a great film but not a bad one either."
49529,"We sat down and watched this movie on Blu-ray yesterday evening to nicely end our little excursion day. This is a good film but it could have been (much) better.
The film itself and its special effects are quite good. I would say that the special effects are very good. The airships are very cool looking. The design nicely captures the retro atmosphere of the book without looking silly. I think they made the green men too slim though. I have always pictured them as way more bulky and monstrous. I like Woola’s appearance although him moving around at “supersonic” speeds is a bit over the top.... read the rest."

'John Carter' can feel underdeveloped and underwhelming you could even argue it aimed to replicate 'Avatar' but there's enough there that allowed me to find a fair amount of enjoyment.
Taylor Kitsch is alright I rate him but a more convincing lead performance was necessary in my opinion. The rest of the cast despite some well known names fail to deliver anything noteworthy. Willem Dafoe works as Tars Tarkas though only due to his distinctive voice; none of his dialogue etc. stand outs. The likes Samantha Morton Mark... read the rest."

Although I wish that would be the only thing wrong with Spider-Man 3.

Right from the get go you hate Peter Parker.

559,"This movie is about Spidey's revenge and transformation to bad Spidey. It has a dark feel to it that I found one of the most appealing factors to this movie. Because we've all gotten used to Peter Parker being ""your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man” having him turn to the dark side for some time and watch him get out of it was a whole new experience."
559,"Tobey Maguire makes such a great Spider-Man hands down. We've seen him at his best but in this movie we saw him at his worst and although I must say I wasn't that big of a fan of how cheesy he looked with that emo cut it was still enjoyable for me watching him beat the ""venom"" out of him."
559,So much emotion in this movie! What a way to end a trilogy!
559,The third and final film to one of the few trilogies we have that are actually good. Tobey surely gave a whole new meaning to Spider-Man and set the bar high for the other Spider-Man movies that came out.
559,I know this is supposed to have a darker tone than the normal Spider-Man movies we see but I found it more comedic to see Peter take on an entirely new character. Loved it though!
559,My wife isn't that big of a superhero fanatic but after watching this whole trilogy with me I can say that she's still not a superhero fan! Still I know she was able to enjoy the movie and how the creators told the story.
559,It still puzzles me to this day why this felt like two movies crammed into one.
559,Now that I think about it this film just had too much going on. Compared to the first two which were both hyper-focused on just one storyline Spider Man 3 lacked that distinct characteristic which I know most of us will agree on.
559,Out of all the Tobey Maguire Spider Man films this one had the best effects. But with that the overall quality of the movie in terms of the plot greatly decreased. I wish they would've stuck with the same strategies they had for the first two films.
38757,"Tangled main characters really remember Aladdin's. The chameleon character could have been more juicy and it also repeats with stubborn determination Disney's intent of making any other animal to behave like dogs.
All in all it is a stereotypical Disney movie that nails the template but it does it so well that it is also really entertaining. In addition they get to add some of the fresh characteristics brought by Shrek to the scene."

99861,There is a lot going on in this movie but it all just seemed kind of pointless and dull to me. Every now and then there would be a good scene or piece of dialogue but for the most part I felt myself getting bored and reaching for my phone to play Cribbage. I guess what I didn't like most is that it all felt like a big filler episode instead of an action packed character driven story arc.

I’ve just returned from two back-to-back viewings of Avengers: Age of Ultron and I do not regret one bit going in for that second helping.
I lost my steam on the Age of Ultron wagon at a very inopportune moment. About three days before it came out. I was so heavily anticipating it for such a long time that I was actually much more excited to see this movie when it was still two months away than I was waiting in line to get into the cinema it was playing at.

99861,"The fact that Joss Whedon was able to salvage some sort of coherent film out of all he was forced to cram into a single movie is quite commendable. But the sad fact is that Avengers: Age of Ultron is really just a run of the mill ""bad guy wants to destroy the world for reasons"" actioner that we've seen done better many times before.
Don't get me wrong. The movie's fun. The dialogue is frequently clever and humourous. And I really appreciated the quiet bits of storytelling that Whedon was able to sneak in. It's just that at the end of the day the villain is weak sauce there's way too much s... read the rest."
99861,Movie was great but felt like there was just too much action and fighting. The creativity of the choreography gets lost in the whirlwind of action and this I noticed most in Captain America's scenes. He does like a hundred different awesome things with his shield but you don't have time to really take it in because you're already looking at Iron Man blasting 20 Ultron-bots to bits.
99861,This is the movie where Captain America became my favorite Avenger. Sure he doesn't have monstrous abilities like Iron Man and Hulk but to be holding his own on the same ground as them is just a testament to how great of a hero he truly is.
99861,It has become a well-known fact that coming out with a sequel that's better than if not on par with the first one is an insane task. But kudos to Marvel for staying true to their colors with this sequel.
99861,I expected more from Quicksilver. He would've been a great addition to the Avengers.
99861,The thing that puzzles me is that in this film Vision is presented to be a powerful hero having the mind stone and all. But on the next films he's become more of like a side character that just wasn't relevant anymore except for that little piece of stone on his forehead. Shame.

""Quantum of Solace is one of the biggest disappointments of the respective decade holding a titanic drop in quality compared to its predecessor. Daniel Craig's dedicated performance isn't enough to save an over-violent James Bond flick packed with terribly handled action sequences - shaky cam and quick cuts may be the worst technical combo in cinema - and an uninspiring utterly boring narrative. Both the villain and the new Bond girls return to being easily forgettable cliches. Despit... read the rest."
10764,"Whilst there is certainly loads of action in this rather procedural outing for ""James Bond"" (a rather uncharismatic Daniel Craig) there is a real dearth of a substantial story. Picking up from ""Casino Royale"" (2006) this film sees our super-spy capture elusive ""Mr White"" (Jesper Christiansen) only to have him escape in the most treacherous of fashions - putting all in MI6 at risk.

And Olga Kurylenko I thought was a great Bond girl plus they brought back Jeffrey Wright as Felix (and it's a reboot so it's OK he has his legs) but it was nice seeing the same person play Felix twice in a row wasn't it?

Many find Quantum of Solace a disappointing entry in the Daniel Craig Bond era but I beg to differ. When viewed as a stand-alone film I can understand frustrations with a meager storyline. But when considered the conclusion of Casino Royale this movie becomes much better. Casino Royale ends with Bond suffering a significant loss and Quantum allows him to take revenge.

That's pretty much what Gore Verbinsky has done with this superior follow-up to the 2003 story. This time we don't really need to spend much time on the who's who bits so can head straight to the action which for the next 2½ hours follows ""Jack Sparrow"" (Johnny Depp) double-dealing as only he can trying to stay one step ahead of the vengeful ""Davy Jones"" (Bill Nighy) with whom he made a deal that means it's now his turn to... read the rest."

Smart choosing to focus in Krypton. Probably the less repeated story told about Superman.
You can really feel Christopher Nolan's touch in the script and probably that's the problem. It is just too similar to Batman Begins.

24428,One of the few movies to actually make me feel like a kid again Joss Whedon was the perfect filmmaker to do this film. Everyone gets their time to shine. The script juggles every plot point and character moment with clarity and ease. It's funny smart and visually jaw dropping. Definitely lived up to the five movie hype.
24428,I give this 10 Stars based on it being not only better than the trailer and the hype made me thing it would be but also that it was the first time anything the size and scope of the Marvel Cinematic universe was pulled off successfully. Having Joss direct this movie lives and dies on character interaction. This movie is on the definitive list in my opinion even just for that.

I liked it it was entertaining. But the Civil War means it's nothing a nation's war within just these super-guys fight for themselves against what kind of administration they want to come under.

I want my heroes to be just that heroes. Unfortunately this movie gets off on the wrong foot right away by not only “incriminating” the Avengers in the eyes of dimwit politicians and putting them on surveillance of a political body but to make matters worse it is the useless black hole of taxpayers money the United Nations that are supposed to surveil them.

It’s commonplace for me to need more than one viewing to really nail down my feelings on a movie that’s particularly true of MCU and even more so of this particular film. That all said here is my initial reaction to Captain America: Civil War.
As is often the case it’s hard to write down too comprehensive a post about a film this early on while remaining totally spoiler-free so for starters I’ll just go ahead and ask the thing that was on my mind from about five minutes in to Civil War: I want to know how it is that two guys wh... read the rest."
271110,"The Captain America movies have managed to ground the MCU by exploring the political and social climate created by the Avengers' existence. Actions have consequences and consequences influence more action.
Civil War isn't as focused as The Winter Soldier. It's also overstuffed with characters and fan service. However the movie works by always being intriguing. Both sides of the conflict are portrayed as equally valid. The exploration of superhero accountability isn't anything new (explored in Watchmen and The Dark Knight) but it's nice to see it incorporated into a grand cinematic universe... read the rest."

Actually that's a little unfair for those after a two hour plus movie of noise and robotic like destruction then this has a modicum of popcorn frivolity about it. But it's all so vacuous any semblance of a story is given over for a chance to show some Transformers effects work the human characters constantly an afterthought as they play second fiddle to another CGI action scene.

This movie was awesome and I think it can stand as a testimonial piece towards the capabilities that Christopher Pratt has. He nailed it. The graphics were awesome the supporting cast did great and the t rex saved the child in me. 10\5 stars four thumbs up and I hope that star wars episode VII doesn't disappoint

135397,I've never been a fan of this series. The only impressive thing of the original was the graphics that were at the time breathtaking. But we all know great graphics alone can't save a film. I watched this new effort just to see how far CGI has come in the time since the original and I can safely say not very far. From the opening scene with the terrible looking and poorly animated bird it's obvious that CGI has reached its limits in recreating realistic content. As for the film.

Annoyingly cliched characters. Stupid story. I thought the idea of commercialism and ethics could have and should have been explored better. A character talks about never being able to match the first part which is true. Not sure if they were trying to be funny or just self-referentially depressing.
Chris Pratt was good. Everyone else was pointless.
No where near the first. I would even prefer to watch Jurassic Park 3 than this.

As a fan of the Jurassic Park franchise especially the first movie I am quite disappointed with Jurassic World. I was honestly super stoked for the long-awaited sequel to Jurassic Park but in the end the movie lacked the charm and mysticism from Jurassic Park. From poorly-developed characters (with the exception of Chris Pratt's Owen Grady) to idiotic plot elements Jurassic World's only saving grace is the fact that it's a sequel to Jurassic Park.

Jurassic World remains my second favorite film of the whole saga.
Colin Trevorrow is able to blend the suspenseful traits of the original with a more adventurous light tone really well. Dinosaurs look amazing still today. Characters could have benefited from a little more work. Decent story.

37724,"Skyfall was a solid movie in its own right but as a Bond movie it was one of my all time favourites. Unlike Quantum of Solace I felt like they actually took the time to tell this story and the pay off was worth it.
Something I found interesting is the idea about Bond getting old and how the job of an MI6 agent is not something you can do forever. It makes me wonder if they might explore some of these themes in the next movie.
It's true that the last 1/3 of Skyfall didn't feel like a Bond movie at all and I think that's why I loved it. The Daniel Craig Bond movies have always taken a dif... read the rest."
37724,Skyfall is a great movie. In my opinion the best proformas by Daniel Craig I have see in all his Bond movies. The title song was not to my taste like in previous movies. The story line is one of the most compelling I have seen in a while. Silva played by Javier Bardem was excellent and he played him very well. All in all a very good movie.
37724,"Bond (Daniel Craig) is on another (important) mission somewhere in the big world this time on the heels of someone who has stolen a hard drive with all the names of the British agents who work for MI6.

However Bond is not dead and when he resurfaces he jumps right into the game in the pursuit of an old agent called Silva (Javier Bardem) an old favorite of M (Judi Dench).

37724,Great theme song and a much more balanced movie compared to Quantum of Solace and the story is well written revealing Bond's background and the motherly relationship with M (contrast with a more antagonistic portrayal in the Brosnan series). Javier Bardem as the villain was fantastic almost Joker like in his planning. The only setback is the finale sure some nice action and explosions but not quite as thrilling versus Casino Royale. Still one of the better in the Bond series overall. 4.0/5

558,Sony did a great job of focusing on what really matters in this movie - the character. Here we see a relatable Peter Parker who can't seem to catch a break and when he does it just feels so satisfying to watch him rise up from all the challenges he faced.
558,To me it felt like what Uncle Ben imparted to Peter in the first film - with great power comes great responsibility - was the very essence of this film. He had too much power too much responsibility and he needed to find a way to balance all of that.

Iron Man 3 brings us into the so called “Phase 2” of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But it does so in a flawed way. I’ve said it before and reiterate it here there is no such thing as a perfect film. But since The Avengers set the bar so very high following that up proved to simply be too much for Black’s entry to handle.

It certainly feels more like a Shane Black movie than an Iron Man movie but that's a great thing. It shows Marvel is willing to give their filmmakers a voice and the room to take risks in their storytelling. Iron Man 3 is a very risky movie and to me it paid off."
68721,"When I first saw this in 2013 strongly disliked it but decided to give it another watch during my re-visit of the MCU and... kind of enjoyed it quite a bit. Still not fond of the twist wasting a great actor in Ben Kingsley to be a decoy Mandarin and instead having a cheesy one with Guy Pearce's Aldrich Killian and his lame ""I AM THE MANDORIAN!"" line.

The 2nd instalment Spider-Man 2 in the first series with Tobey Maquire still holds that title firmly.

It's not so much that it's a bad film or a bad Spider-Man film at that it's just that it feels all very familiar whilst simultaneously hugging the same pitfalls as Sam Raimi's Spiderman 3. Webb tries to juggle a screenplay with 3 villains (well two and a half reall... read the rest."

There is quite a degree of on-screen chemistry between Garfield and Stone and as an action-romance this is at the more entertaining end of the scale.

It is a nice fairy tale based on the Sleeping Beauty but from the perspective of the evil fairy (who is not really that evil actually) instead. As far as I am concerned the concept worked surprisingly well.
Obviously the story is highly rewritten compared to the original Sleeping Beauty story. Whether that is good or bad is probably a matter of personal opinion. I think it is good since it allowed to story in the movie to have its own merit... read the rest."

1966,Opinion on this film seems to have been hijacked somewhat by the definition and appropriateness of the relationship between Alexander (Farrell) and Hephaestion (Leto). It seems daft to try to apply 21st century social morals onto a society in which same sex relationships were simply unremarkable. Whether or not it was about sex or love or both isn't really that important - I think Oliver Stone was trying to involve us in a much more complex story of human nature.

Hancock had character at the start of the film but that slowly faded away by the second half that just sort of floundered until it ended.
It lacked the humor that comes with a lot of Will Smith's other outings and it lacks the charisma that usually seeps out of Smith.
It just seemed to fail on every front."
8960,"Despite being one of the great films of Will Smith's career it is a weak and uninteresting film.
I think almost everyone who has seen superhero movies especially the bigger budget ones has wondered how it's possible that those heroes are so destructive: in order to eliminate an enemy or a danger they destroy half a city as collateral damage. This film works precisely on top of that: Hancock is a superhero who doesn't seem to want to be one and who doesn't know how to deal with it.

We have become so materialistic and driven with the energy of getting everything fast we have lost the essence of our lives and the importance of kindness. It’s a book you not only want to gift to your kids but you want to read yourself as well.

Despite a virtually non-existent (comparatively) promotional campaign for Marvel’s latest effort Thor: The Dark World has crushed its competition box-office-wise. Though receiving less critical acclaim than Captain Phillips or Gravity it did clean up in the finance department.
I’ve made no secret of the fact that in the MCU my favourite Avenger is Thor so a new film was always going to be an easy ticket from me. And I can’t work out if that bias is making me more critical of the film because I care so much or less because I’m just happy it got made?... read the rest."

All in all Thor: The Dark World is not a terrible movie. It's just far more cliché than its predecessors and that's disappointing."

76338,I don't understand all the hate surrounding this movie. I loved every bit of it and somehow to me it feels like this was even better than its predecessor. Better CGI a darker sci-fi fantasy plot and improved action sequences make it a truly great sequel to the first film.
76338,Didn't enjoy it as much as the first one but watched it for the sake of keeping up with the timeline and making sure I wasn't missing any information critical to understanding the next Avengers movie coming out.
76338,One of the first Marvel movies I watched and though I don't know a lot yet about him I can say that Chris Hemsworth plays Thor quite well.
76338,Not as Thor-y as the first one but definitely gives Thor some character development which let's all agree he needs in order for him to establish better his role as one of the main heroes in The Avengers.

I think in this situation I'm as close as you get to the average movie goer. No agenda no attachments. That being said this film is terrible.

Of course there is the romance stuff but I personally feel that is really more of a background or justification to the plot than anything else.

That all takes away the fun of a movie that had the potential to be a high seas epic like say Captain Blood.

The plot to this one is an improvement even if it doesn't massively change it up. I do like as in the first film how the real life humans are merged in with the animation though.

Dubbed as a “re-quel” The Incredible Hulk was first released in 2008 and now I’m here to review it in the line of Marvel films I’m getting through a the moment.
I always like to think of films individually but with the Marvel Cinematic Universe getting so big that can be rather difficult to do. So though I may comment on films in relation to their sequels remakes prequels spin-offs parodies and the like know that my final score out of ten is always based purely on the films merits or lack thereof.

1724,It's an improvement on the Ang Lee film only in the sense that the smashy smashy bits are more entertaining than the previous film's thinky thinky bits. But the fact that the entire film is just one long extended fight scene is disappointing to us who enjoy the darker more emotional beats of the Hulk's story. I enjoy this movie quite a bit as a well put together piece of fluff entertainment but I hold no delusions that even Marvel Studios couldn't get the definitive version of Hulk on screen.
1724,"Much more enjoyable than the 2003 film which this 2008 release reboots. So that's a positive. As for a follow-up in the MCU it's a little underwhelming if still passably good - at least to me.
'The Incredible Hulk' is closer to being forgettable than it is to being memorable but that's not to say I didn't have a solid time watching. It's only really the ending that I felt dragged yet even then it still has positive moments.

From a technical point of view The Revenant is one of the most masterful pieces of cinema I've ever seen. This made its one technical failure all the more jarring. The ADR. I don't know how or why this was allowed to happen but the dubbing of the Native Americans is some 70's style shit it's awful and it's awful every single time.

It's rather gruesome and bloody while it also has a few top notch action sequences.

LOUISA SAYS:
“Jason Bourne” is a spy movie for imbeciles. The entire film feels like it’s written using nothing more than the vocabulary of a 12 year old and consists of two very tiring hours of repetition. Bourne gets chased throws some punches and gets away. Shoot bleed run escape. Shoot bleed run escape. Shoot bleed run escape. Repeat to infinity.
I actually felt bad for the actors having to deliver such dreadful dialogue; their onscreen characters literally describe everything that’s happening as it unfolds (“It’s Bourne!... read the rest."

I thought the original films are meant to be a trilogy but when filmmakers saw money they went ahead with the fourth in a new direction. So now with this it has returned to the original storyline. The Jason Bourne whose quest to find the answers was over. Yet a new chapter begins with this like another trilogy is on making like the 'Star Wars' with a new storyline and adventures.
Still the theme remains the same like running and chasing. So the story was just a one or two liner. But if you like the action sequence... read the rest."

Sure I’ll just take the overly stylised sauce. My personal adoration for this sequel’s predecessor is one that cannot be described fully without tackling the realms of lunacy and diminishing my own critical insight. It’s just a special piece of camp nostalgia for me even if its construction is more amateurish than Diaz’ dance moves.

You would have thought that with such a budget they could have hired some guy to make a basic sanity check of the script but obviously that wasn’t in the budget for this one. I do not know if a lot of Hollywood people are idiots or think the audience are idiots or both but for Christ sake how difficult can it be to come up with a plot that holds together and are at least half believable?

Aliens was a fun movie. But it was just Space Marines v Monsters. It was just a merger of action and science fiction.

No I got even more than I could have hoped for.

Didn't exactly land the emotional impact they were going for in the end but still was enjoyed this quite a bit and think it's actually better than District 9 (which I feel is overrated outside of the visual effects) and far and away better than Chappie. 3.75/5

2789,"It's hard for me to say that The Chronicles of Riddick is good. Especially taking into the stunning origin it has in Pitch Black. But it tries really hard. It tries to be good it tries to be original it tries to appeal to so many disparate groups it tries to go in a completely new direction. This trying mostly translates to failure and I guess I can see that but Chronicles of Riddick still had such a massive impact on me that I still have to recommend it.

Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go."
2789,"This is very much a vehicle for Vin Diesel to flex his muscles and engage in 2 hours of kick-ass adventure.

However it lacks a lot of the appeal the over the top gory violence and the cartoonish wow-factor that the original has.

There are so many subtle moments throughout this adventure I couldn't begin to count. Just a couple of the main ones are Roy is a spy who doesn't lie he also has the morality of an untainted youngster. You need to watch this movie without action-tinted glasses.

I was completely engaged and interested as we learned about this repair crew who had the left overs of earth to themselves. They could have ran with that single idea for 2 hours and I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have complained.
All is not lost though visually Oblivion was a blast and M83 did a great job with the soundtrack. If you like science fiction movies you should probably add this to your watch list but don't expect too much. Overall you'll probably be disappointed."

I watch movies to be entertained and I don't care too much about realism especially in SciFi movies maybe that's why I enjoy watching Oblivion again and again.
75612,Oblivion was a decent watch. It had an interesting concept at first but as the layers began to unfold it felt bloated and contrived. It was as if the writers were adding fake depth to story that was very surface level. Performances were pretty bad too Tom Cruise felt out of place in a sci-fi film and none of the other actors worked for me. There is some gorgeous cinematography and an absolutely masterful score that helps raise the score bit. I really enjoyed the more quiet moments that were just Cruise and the world one in particular was the scenes of him at his cabin on the lake. Overall... read the rest.

Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are strong choices to enter the franchise I enjoyed both of them. Jake Lloyd does a fine job in his role while the likes of Terence Stamp Samuel L. Jackson and Keira Knightley also feature. Natalie Portman appears too but I honestly never really cared for her lot's side of the story. Ahmed Best meanwhile is very hit-and-miss as Jar Jar Binks.

The blast of horns for John Willams' score occurred and the title scrawl happened droidikas appeared - I had a buzz going.
But that buzz got less and less as the film wore on. Jar Jar appeared...and then Anakin trying to crack onto Padme...Darth Maul appeared and I got excited but the dialogue continued like a child had written it and the excitement had dissipated by the time the Pod Race started.
It was the first time I had really been deeply disappointed by a movie.... read the rest."

Rewatching it before OBI-WAN KENOBI.
Even ignoring the lack of narrative impact of THE PHANTOM MENACE in Luke Skywalker's journey it still doesn't work for me. The climactic lightsaber fight and the podracing are cool but the terrible dialogue awful editing Jar Jar and the f****** midi-chlorians ruin the whole thing.

The opening scenes are great: a good fight with lots of action and lightsabres; then it descends into a sort of cross between ""Ben Hur"" and ""The Golden Child"" with some pantomime thrown in too. The film is clearly designed to be part one of another trilogy and as such spends way too much of it's time setting the scenes and establishing the characters for the films to follow. We do start to get a sense of the evil ""Palpatine"" and it looks spectacular but it is basically pretty e... read the rest."

This is a sequel as well as a prequel to the 2012 film 'Snow White and Huntsman'. It opened with the earlier story where and how the Huntsman grew up especially the journey of his innocent childhood to a great fighter that covers in the first half an hour.

The story is partly before and partly after the events in Snow White and The Huntsman. It is a good adventure with plenty of magic and special effects and a fair bit of action. It is a fairly straightforward story without much in terms of surprises.
There is a bit of comical relief in particular by the dwarfs especially when the two dwarfs following the hun... read the rest."

Why try to rewrite a story that was actually not bad when you cannot be bothered to spend some effort on it?

The part that I felt dragged down the movie the most is that Dr. Ryan is behaving rather clumsily and amateurish first being real slow in obeying the order to evacuate and then floating around huffing and puffing talking a lot when she should really conserve oxygen.

This movie absolutely earned its place on the list of “1001 Movies to See Before You Die.”"

The entire movie is so isolated and desperate it is incredibly immersive. It had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. The script is a bit rough at times a large portion of the dialogue does not seem realistic and can come off as corny sometimes especially with George Clooney's character. Overall it is short face paced and thrilling and I would highly recommend.

So there was some apprehension going into TMNT: Out of the Shadows because traditionally sequels were worse than their parent films.
Well Turtles wasn't. The second film is actually much better than the first. It still has hard- to-digest action sequences right out of Michael Bay's wet dreams but this one also had some heart. It had a theme.

Overall it's a little more watchable but what affects this most is the messy ending - especially with the CGI which looks like a video game.

Disaster films are easy to kick because very rarely they are nothing more than candy carnage with a trite screenplay and cheese laden dialogue. Such is the case with San Andreas.

The movie seems to reflect this in that it has a fairly simple straightforward adventure plot. This is a movie made to entertain with magic adventure a bit of humor and visual effects.

331,"I guess you could call this Jurassic Park Lite. Everything about it is reduced. It has a much shorter running time and the plot is contracted to the point that it is just about a handful of people looking for a child in a violently wild zoo. They enticed Sam Neil back into the cast and to a lesser extent Laura Dern but the movie seems to feel the absence of Jeff Goldblum’s Ian character. The script seems to recognize this lack as they have Alan Grant whipping out quotes and theories of Ian’s. Meanwhile I think William H. Macy’s talents might have been a bit wasted in his role.

This is a good film to watch with the family because it will easily appeal to young people and adults alike.

'The Alamo' to me at least is an incredibly slow-paced and rather boring 137 minutes. Not even the free-for-all action sequences bring any true entertainment due to the chaotic filming nature of them; I get there's supposed to be pandemonium but the camera work is a mess.
Another negative to note is the score which is one of the poorest I've heard.

It all began on Christmas Day. Many people forget that Cast Away is technically a Christmas movie. The fateful plane crash that strands Tom Hanks on an island alone with his volleyball best friend Wilson takes off and leaves his new fiance alone on Christmas Day. There are some fantastic aspects to this film. Tom Hanks once again gives an Oscar-worthy performance committing himself entirely to the role that honestly carried the film. Everyone loves T... read the rest."

Completely ill-suited for life without any modern conveniences but not without a brain cell or two he has to adapt à la ""Robinson Crusoe"" to his new life of coconuts and whatever fish he can catch. The story takes it's time but that all contributes well to the effectiveness of his performance as he must deal with the physical logistical and increasingly psychological challenges his predicament throws... read the rest."

2502,"The Bourne Supremacy is my favorite of the franchise because it cranks up the action raises the stakes but also remembers to grow and deepen its characters.
The Bourne Supremacy takes Bourne to new heights with bigger set pieces and effects as well as new depths by exploring more of Bourne’s mysterious past and trauma. The action in Supremacy is cranked up with a larger budget allowing more exciting sequences with multiple car chases explosions and hand-to-hand fights. This sequel also highlights Bourne’s spy craft and skills at infiltrating. He pieces the clues of a mystery together... read the rest."

9772,It’s a quite nice action flick. Some people on Rotten Tomatoes and other sites have been moaning that it was too much American patriotism. Well that’s a load of bullshit! Sure it was very American but given the name and the cast what the hell did these morons expect? If one cannot enjoy a good American action movie because of some patriotism in it well then do not watch them! Incidentally there are some countries in Europe no names mentioned cough cough that could do with some more patriotism in the first place. Anyway for us it was two enjoyable hours and hey it's Harrison Ford after al... read the rest.
9772,"Harrison Ford for President!
Is this a typical action flick with the only significant differentiation being the hero's name is led by the word President? Yes indeed. But with the great Harrison Ford playing the hero and the always brilliant Gary Oldman as the antagonist this impressive cast raises this movie from an action rehash to a classic. If you love 80s/90s action then Air Force One is for you."

After a Russian terrorist (Gary Oldman) hijacks Air Force One with his cronies the President (Harrison Ford) is intent on saving his wife & daughter and the other hostages (e.g. William H. Macy). Glenn Close plays the Vice President while Dean Stockwell is on hand as the Defense Secretary.
“Air Force One” (1997) is a political suspense/thriller that combines “Under Siege” (1992) with “Executive Decision” (1996). While I prefer those two this one’s in the same league.

9772,This is all about Harrison Ford and his ability to almost single-handedly carry over 2 hours of cinema. The plot is ridiculous - Air Force One is hijacked by a group of highly trained terrorists led by Gary Oldman who quite easily commandeer the plane and hold the President hostage - except that is that he too is an extremely highly trained man who dupes them into thinking he has been ejected in a life pod. Soon we have a cunning Mexican stand-off at 35000 feet with just about everyone else being a casualty.

Literally fresh out of prison Danny Ocean is busy setting up a seemingly impossible robbery. The plan along with ten other experts he has roped in is to rob the main vault at Las Vegas that houses the takings from the three main casinos.
The original Ocean's 11 released in 1960 is an OK film more watchable for the Vegas setting and the irrepressible cast of Rat Packers than for any purpose or structure. That this Steven Soderbergh remake trumps the original in every department is a triumph of entertainment values over pure star appeal. Some would put... read the rest."

As far as heist movies go it's excellent but I think I'm very picky when it comes to heist movies. In order to get me behind the criminal protagonist it needs to be overly complex but not complicated and there needs to be an alternative motive such as ""get the girl"".

Ocean's Eleven greatest strength is its emersion of the audience into the midst of a story already in motion.

It was sufficient to entertain I suppose but will quickly fade from memory. Then again the action drama genre is not what I call home. You throw in some humor and you stand a chance of holding my attention which it just about managed.

I must really like this story given I rated and similarly enjoyed the 1993 version from Stephen Herek and Disney - I even put this one above that one! This 2011 version starts off so strongly I love the opening few scenes... humour and editing was right up my street.

Other than that the script and dialogues are not so brilliant. It was boring for a big deal of the time and there were too many things going on and too fast.
You can recognize Genndy Tartakovsky's style in the movie but I've liked other of his works much more than this."

Like I mean I was prepared to appreciate it less than the majority of audiences I often don't love kids' media and I'm not really a fan of Adam Sandler but I didn't think that I wouldn't find any appeal in it at all. This is just one I genuinely do not see what people are talking about when they give it a favourable review.
Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible."

10481,I remember loving this film as a kid. Rewatching the film as an adult the film does not hold up. I really remember the third act of the film before rewatching the film and it is going to be the only thing I will remember about the film. There are two fun scenes in my opinion: the ending and Cruella De Vil transformation back into her evil self. Glenn close is the only great thing from the film. This is not one you need to seek out if you have not seen it.

The script is witty and there is good chemistry between the prospective couples although it takes a while to develop with Amanda and Graham due to their awkward and clunky start. The old guy Arthur and the two children also add to the depth of the story.
My only real issue was their deploying that awkward rom-com device when two characters have sex first and then fall in love.

Unfortunately the actors playing the main protagonists and the special effects were atrocious the paper-thin plot was resoundingly predictable and I couldn't wait till it ended.
Definitely one Burger that was way overdone.
Of course Hollywood garbage like this produces a ton of sequels while much better and original projects get kicked to the gutter."
157350,A new world order type of movie. With 5 different factions. It was an ok movie but we only really learn about 2 of the factions really in this movie. What about the other 3.

16281,I know I'll probably get a lot of flak for suggesting this but I strongly feel that this anthology piece director Romero did largely helped by Stephen King is Romero's finest outing outside of his seven zombie films (of which so far I've seen five). One of the best by one director as well--and it puts the much-more-celebrated 'Twilight Zone: The Movie' which came out around the same time to shame. Definitely one to purchase and rewatch for the horror aficionados amongst you. The 80's weren't so bad...

Here director Guillermo del Toro lets loose all bars on his fantasy elements stacking the movie with elves trolls even tooth fairies making for a less grim but still very good Hellboy sequel. Not to mention it features personal favourite Luke Goss in what is probably his best role to date.

1949,"Peerless precision from Fincher.
I have seen it written that this film shows that Fincher had grown up and whilst I understand that train of thought it simply isn't true. What Fincher has done is give a true story his meticulous care and standard deft precision by leaving no stone unturned. We get simply one of the (if not thee) best films to deal with the investigating process of a high profile serial killer a film that as a character study is actually essential viewing in the pantheon of genre productions.

I've already revisited Se7en and Fight Club two iconic films that not only profoundly impacted filmmaking but also our culture.

1949,A great character driven crime-drama with wonderful performances from Gyllenhaal Ruffalo and Downey Jr. Been a few years since I last saw this one but decided to give it a re-watch (seen it I think five times now including the rated version in theaters and then DVD). Even though it's 2.75 hours never gets dull and is engrossing through and through even if the conclusion might not be accurate. 4.5/5
1949,"Two years before Zodiac Capote depicted Truman Capote making a fuss about possibly not having an ending for his seminal true crime novel In Cold Blood. Robert Graysmith on whose non-fiction books Zodiac is based had no such qualms nor did director David Fincher. The comparison may be unfair; Graysmith is no Capote (but then who is?) and In Cold Blood isn’t a whodunit – though technically neither is Zodiac since after more than two hours we don’t learn who [has] done it so much as who-a-very-small-group-of-people-think-done-it.

Fans of Jim Carrey can't go wrong with this fun filled picture that's not without serious undertones as well.

Having enough of his whingeing God (Morgan Freeman) summons Nolan to his ""residence"" and bestows all his powers to him.

Pros: strong performance from the star. Technically excellent.

Gory beautiful authentic looking certainly - but fiction nonetheless. Taken on that basis then it is still an entertaining mediaeval drama depicting the struggle... read the rest.

Elizabeth Mitchell is decent as Carol while Spencer Breslin - who is good in 'The Cat in the Hat' and yes I like that film - fits his character well. My point being this has a slightly improved support cast.... read the rest."

Ideas were added as the years progressed like the ""penance stare"" and Blaze's growing awareness of the former angel of justice Zarathos. The book was canceled in 1983 after a ten-year run.

Plot plays like an episode of Criminal Minds which isn't a bad thing to me. Also fun seeing Nick Offerman in a bit role. 3.25/5
11892,"This is yet another role in which Sandra Bullock plays a cop on the outskirts of her team. She is ""Cassie"" a woman with intimacy issues who gets teamed up with ""Sam"" (Ben Chaplin) whom she toys with as if he were a kitten both personally and on their case to investigate what looks like the perfect murder. A distinct lack of clues leads her bloodhound nose to a school where without the slightest shred of evidence she alights on the wealthy ""Haywood"" (Ryan Gosling) to whom she takes an instant dislike. Further ferreting around lead the pair to ""Pendleton"" (Michael Pitt) who is partial to a lit... read the rest."

Sly Stallone stars as an ageing assassin who gets embroiled in a cat and mouse game with a younger assassin who wants to be number one of the trade. Teaming up with a computer hacker Stallone battles not only his pursuer but also an event from his past that troubles him so.
With Antonio Banderas and Julianne Moore in starry support Richard Donner in the director's chair and the Wachowski brothers on writing duties Assassins held the promise of a top line actioner. Sadly that promise is not met.

A Stallone/Banderas as cat and mouse assassins sounds promising but in reality this technoir thriller is... Actually kind of boring. Seems like it needs a ground-up re-working to get a story up to the concept of that team which sounds exhausting.
Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me but a poor finished product."

Indeed director Peter Webber and author Thomas Harris bring us Hannibal Lector (ne: Lecter) the formative years. Off the bat you have to say it's not overtly a horror film something which has proved to have annoyed many who ventured in expecting something different. Which on one hand is a shame because it's a very effective thriller ripe with literary smarts and boasting some very good acting performances. While there is horrors around genuine ones that history has taught us as fact.

I like the plot of 'Blood Work'. I'm unsure if it would hold up if you went through with a fine-tooth comb but it certainly gave me the required enjoyment levels.

10061,90s cheese not quite as good as 80s cheese but still an entertaining enough action-thriller though some moments were laughable and not in a good way (Snake riding surfing a wave isn't all that bad ass) plus the effects work was rather poor. I don't have a great fondness for Escape from New York however it was far superior. 3.0/5

'Free State of Jones' tells the true story of Newton Knight's role in the American Civil War. As you'd hope/expect it leads to captivating viewing. Matthew McConaughey is superb while he's supported excellently by Mahershala Ali.
It's tough to watch in large portions given the obvious things from the Civil War era from the war itself but also to slavery. I had never heard of Newton Knight so it was very interesting for me to see it unfold and learning bits - even with some creative license I'm sure. It also serves an important message that slavery didn't end wi... read the rest."

Pretty entertaining action flick with a fast paced narration. A typical Liam Neeson's movie. Take a gun and go hunt down the bad guys or protect loved ones from them kind of movie.

There isn't a lot of comedy in fantasy movies and there isn't a lot of fantasy in comedies typically so I'm sure they thought they were corning a rather unique market. Honestly though it's like they had someone write a really great Dungeons and Dragon movie and then tried to ruin it with humor page by page.

9923,This is a movie I previously watched 15+ years ago didn't like it then; still don't like it today. Tony Soctt's style which leaned much more toward gritty oversaturation in his latter films was a bit too much for me as was the frenetic direction and editing which failed in keeping me entertained or caring for any of these characters and this coming from someone who loves Keira Knightley. On the plus side at least the video and audio still hold up shame the rest of film and its good cast never came together. 2.0/5
11863,"Well this is trying to be an erotic thriller and it is trying to be neo noir... and it doesn't pull off either.
It seems to be constantly confused about which way to go never committing to either genre and not really merging them together very well. Which is pretty sad given that erotic thriller and Noir tend to mix nicely for the most part and can seemlessly transition.
Jade didn't know how to mix them and it couldn't decide which it wanted to be.
So in the end it hints at both and falls flat in both."

Everything I wrote was just my personal opinion definitely not intended to offend anybody.
